Citi Bike Program Data Analysis and Visualization
Congratulations on your new role as the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program! As the overseer of the largest bike-sharing program in the United States, you are tasked with generating regular reports to improve and publicize the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has collected comprehensive data on its utilization, which is made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

# Before You Begin
Save this assignment to your Tableau Public account, as it allows for easy sharing and continuous access to your workbook.

If you don't have a Tableau Public account, create one to get started.

For your analysis, select and download 1-3 zip files from the Citi Bike Data source. Choose data with consistent columns, preferably from within the past year, to simplify merging datasets.

# Instructions
Your primary task is to aggregate the data from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and uncover two unexpected phenomena. You are encouraged to work with a timespan of your choice and can optionally merge multiple datasets from different periods.

Design 2-5 visualizations for each phenomenon, resulting in a total of 4-10 visualizations. Your creative approach to answering questions and finding insights is welcomed!

Here are some potential starting points for your analysis:

Total number of recorded trips during the chosen period.

Percentage growth in total ridership.

Changes in the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers.

Peak hours for bike usage during summer and winter months.

Top 10 starting and ending stations in the city, along with possible reasons for their popularity.

Bottom 10 starting and ending stations and reasons behind their low usage.

Average trip duration by user type.

Average distance in miles for a bike trip.

Bikes (by ID) that may require repair or inspection during the timespan.

Utilization variability by bike ID.

For city officials, create either a basic static map or an advanced dynamic map with zip code data overlaid, showcasing popular bike stations and their changes over time.

Your visualizations should form the basis of dashboards and a Tableau story that ties all the insights together in a professional, logical, and visually appealing manner.

# Submission
Once your Tableau workbook and presentation are ready:

Save your assignment to your Tableau Public profile.

Share the URL to your Tableau Public workbook along with any additional files used in your analysis.

With your data analysis and visualization expertise, contribute to improving the Citi Bike program and providing valuable insights to city officials. If you encounter challenges or need assistance, feel free to seek guidance from instructors or peers. Best of luck with your analysis and storytelling!
